Data Explorer
=============

**Data Explorer** is a Python-based tool designed to analyze and visualize high-dimensional data using clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) techniques. It facilitates the reduction of data dimensionality and provides intuitive visualizations to aid in data interpretation.

Features
--------

-   **Data Loading**: Supports loading datasets from various formats for analysis.

-   **Dimensionality Reduction**: Implements PCA to reduce data dimensions while retaining significant variance.

-   **Clustering**: Applies clustering algorithms to group similar data points, aiding in pattern recognition.

-   **Visualization**: Generates visual representations of clustered data to enhance interpretability.

Models Used
-----------

The project leverages machine learning models primarily focused on dimensionality reduction and clustering. Below is an explanation of these models:

-   **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:

    -   **Purpose**:\
        PCA is used to transform a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much variance as possible. This transformation helps in visualizing the data and reducing computational complexity.

    -   **Implementation**:\
        The `pca.py` module typically implements PCA using libraries such as scikit-learn. It involves computing the covariance matrix of the data, determining its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and then projecting the data onto the top principal components.

    -   **Usage**:\
        After computing the PCA transformation, the reduced data can be used for visualization or as input to clustering algorithms.

-   **Clustering Models**:

    -   **Purpose**:\
        Clustering helps to group data points that have similar characteristics. This can reveal natural segments or patterns within the data.

    -   **Common Algorithms**:\
        Although the core focus is on dimensionality reduction with PCA, the repository might include implementations or interfaces to common clustering algorithms (such as K-means or hierarchical clustering).

    -   **Model Storage**:\
        Trained clustering models and PCA components may be saved in the `models/` folder. This allows for model persistence, so that you don't have to retrain models every time you analyze new data.

    -   **Integration**:\
        Once the data is transformed via PCA, the clustering models can be applied to the lower-dimensional representation to identify clusters or segments in the data.

Project Structure
-----------------

The repository is organized as follows:

-   `data/`: Contains sample datasets used for analysis.

-   `images/`: Stores visual outputs generated by the tool.

-   `models/`: Includes trained models and related artifacts.

-   `outputs/`: Holds result files produced from analyses.

-   `utils/`: Consists of utility scripts and helper functions.

-   `main.py`: The primary script to execute data analysis workflows.

-   `pca.py`: Module dedicated to performing PCA on datasets.

-   `test.py`: Contains test cases to validate the functionality of the tool.

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

-   Python 3.x
